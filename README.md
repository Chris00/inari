**inari** is a Rust implementation of [interval arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic).

## Supported Rust Versions

A **nightly** toolchain >= `nightly-2021-10-05` is required.

This is because there are a few unstable features that the crate depends on: [`asm`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72016), [`stdsimd`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48556), etc. To use the crate as a dependency, you need to [override the toolchain](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) in your project. Here is an [example](https://github.com/unageek/graphest/blob/master/rust-toolchain) that does this with the `rust-toolchain` file.

## Supported Platforms

The following CPUs are supported:

- x86-64

  Haswell-based and newer processors are supported.

  You need to specify the target CPU when building a crate that depends on inari. One way to do that is using a [configuration file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html) in your project (see [example](https://github.com/unageek/graphest/blob/master/.cargo/config.toml); you may want to change `native` to `haswell` to achieve maximum compatibility if you are going to distribute executables).

- AArch64 (ARM64)

  Experimental, it is not tested continuously.

When using the Cargo feature `gmp` (see below), the target platforms are limited to the ones that are supported by the [`gmp-mpfr-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/gmp-mpfr-sys) crate.

## Cargo Features

- `gmp` (enabled by default) - Enables operations that depend on GMP and MPFR, namely, the transcendental functions and conversion between texts and intervals. You can opt-out the feature to reduce dependencies. Even in that case, you still have access to all arithmetic operations that are required for making robust geometric predicates, for example.
